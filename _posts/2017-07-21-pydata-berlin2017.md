## PyData Berlin 2017

This year I was lucky to receive a travel scholarship to attend the PyData Berlin Conference 2017. This blog post summaries the main highlights for me. I've provided links to code and videos wherever possible. Hopefully, this might be a useful guide for anyone who couldn't attend and is wondering what videos to watch when they're uploaded.

TL;DR version: My storified tweets.

```python
# Python comment test
import glob
data_dir = 'tutorial-corpus/*'
novel_paths = glob.glob(data_dir)
print(novel_paths)
```

## Tutorials - Friday

### 1. Julia // [Names] (find twitter)

This tutorial was designed for absolute beginners which was great because I myself have no experience with Julia and wasn't really sure what it was intended for.

### 2. Pandas and Big Data // Steve Simmons (find twitter)

This tutorial was designed for absolute beginners which was great because I myself have no experience with Julia and wasn't really sure what it was intended for.

### 3. Advanced Metaphors in Python Programming // [James Powell](https://twitter.com/dontusethiscode)

From the start this tutorial carried an air of mystery (it helped that there was no description provided on the conference page). So naturally, I had to go and find out what it was about. James Powell definitely didn't disappoint and  

I'm going to go into a little more detail for this tutorial as the notes will not be available online although the video will be on the PyData Youtube channel. Which I will link to when it becomes available. James essentially covered four main devices in python. The reason notes are not online because it's not going to be posting code versions either. In the same spirit

**Metaclasses: General idea is that people usually say donâ€™t use it without understanding the features it provides.**

primary way of making sure if someone is going to use your class they follow the correct procedure to use it.

**Decorators: Higher order decorators usually discussed / beginner class, never really deeper.**

convenient syntax for common patterns that repeat throughout code where function calls function etc. make function calling function etc that is used to make sure classes within classes, fun

**Generators: Generators enforce sequencing. They allow one to break up a specific computation into different parts into an enforced sequence.**

easy way to iterator over something in sequence.

**Context Managers: Content managers are all about these problems: opening/closing files memory.**

Do something to set up some state or context and make sure you clean up after yourself.


### 4. Topic Modeling with Gensim // [Friend Name](https://twitter.com/dontusethiscode)

20 mins to set up envirenment. Most important feature is to make sure you're preprocessing text correctly. Highly recommended SpaCy (link to twitter or website here).

Takeaway message, text preprocessing very import and knowing how to clean your data set before applying a topic model and SpaCy iho is the best library for this. (this applies to word2vec too.)

## Conference - Saturday and Sunday

This tutorial was designed for absolute beginners which was great because I myself have no experience with Julia and wasn't really sure what it was intended for.


Hmm... this 3D code box looks bad. Look into changing it.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
