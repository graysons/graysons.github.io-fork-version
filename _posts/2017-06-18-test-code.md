This week I’m presenting a part of my collaborative work with the Nation, Gender, Genre (link) project at LKD2017 in Galway (link). This is just a short blogpost to summarise the main results and present the word embedding visualisation in a little more detail. Warning! This post does not include my code as I haven’t had a chance to clean it up just yet. I’ll follow this post a little later with it (it’s in python if you’re curious), but for now I’ll provide an outline of my methodology as well as a link to some sample data from the Nation, Gender, Genre project itself (which is a fascinating collaboration to be apart of and you should definitely check out the link!).

Meow, meow, meow, meow.

```python
# Python comment test
import glob
data_dir = 'tutorial-corpus/*'
novel_paths = glob.glob(data_dir)
print(novel_paths)
```

Hmm... this 3D code box looks bad. Look into changing it.
