I am a 2nd year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/users/siobhan-grayson), University College Dublin.
My primary research involves identifying structure in multi-relational social networks under the supervision of [Dr. Derek Greene](https://www.insight-centre.org/users/derek-greene). My research interests include machine learning, social network analysis, digital humanities, natural language processing, time series analysis, and anomaly detection.

Currently, I am apart of the ['Nation, Genre, and Gender'](http://www.nggprojectucd.ie/) project, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Insight Centre and the [Humanities Institute](http://www.ucd.ie/humanities/) at UCD. The aim of this project is to study a collection of Irish and British novels from the 19th Century using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in order to examine these works from new perspectives.

Furthermore, as well as conducting my own research and collaborating with the Humanities Institute, I am also involved in an industry partnership with [Curtiss-Wright](http://www.curtisswright.com/home/default.aspx). My work involves implementing a system which can detect anomalies and classify, in real-time, faults that may occur within complex aviation systems

Additional interests of mine can be found scattered across the web [here](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~graysons/) and [here](https://twitter.com/siobhan_grayson/lists).
